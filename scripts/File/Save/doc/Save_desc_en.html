This command saves the current drawing to the same file it was loaded from.
If you want to save a newly created drawing or save the current drawing to a
new file, use the menu 
<a href="../../SaveAs/doc/SaveAs_en.html">File - Save As</a> instead. You will
then
be asked for a file name before the drawing is saved.
