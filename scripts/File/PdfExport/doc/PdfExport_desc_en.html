<p>This tool exports the current drawing to a PDF file. Exporting to PDF is
very similar to printing a drawing. You will most likely have to adjust
your drawing scale and drawing position as well as page settings before
exporting a drawing to PDF.
<br/>
For this reason, QCAD automatically switches to the print preview when 
this tool is used. If the print preview does not match your expectations,
cancel the export, adjust the page settings and start the PDF export again.
