<p>Dimensions are used to add measurements to a drawing. 
<br />Dimensions typically consist of a text label and some lines and arrows to
indicate the precise location of the measurement. The text label may be
accompanied by tolerance indications or symbols. The options tool bar that is
shown while a dimension is being created supports you to define the dimension
label contents and its tolerances.</p>
