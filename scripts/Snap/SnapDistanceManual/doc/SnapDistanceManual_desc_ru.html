<p>This tool allows you to snap to a point that lays on the imaginary
line between two points at a given distance from the first point.
<br/>
This snap tool does not restrict the distance, percentage or fraction 
entered. Entering a distance greater than the distance between the two points,
a percentage greater than 100 or a fraction greater than 1.0 will allow you 
to snap to a point beyond the second point. 
<br/>
Negative values can be entered to snap to points beyond the first point.
<br/>
Fractions may be entered as decimal numbers (0.5, 0.7) or as fractions
(1/7, 3/11).</p>
