<p>Panning means moving (scrolling) around in a drawing. The quickest way to do
so is using the middle mouse button and move the view similar like you would
move a paper around: press the middle mouse button and hold it while moving the
drawing around. If your mouse does not have a middle mouse button you can press
the Control key (Mac OS X: Command key) and use the left mouse button instead. 
<br />Alternatively, you can activate this tool and then move the view with the
left mouse button without pressing any keys. 
<br />Click the right mouse button when you are done.</p>
