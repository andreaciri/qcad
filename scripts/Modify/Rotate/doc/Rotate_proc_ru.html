  <li>Select the entities you want to rotate.</li>
  <li>Launch this tool.</li>
  <li>Set the center of the rotation with the mouse or enter a coordinate in
  the command line.</li>

  and the rotation angle. 
  <br />If you want to specify the rotation angle with the mouse cursor, check

  <br />To delete the original entities, check "Delete Original", to copy them
  choose "Keep Original". You can also create any given number of copies by
  choosing "Multiple Copies". 
  <br />The new entities are placed on the same layer as the originals and
  have the same attributes. To use the current layer and current attributes
  instead, tick "Use current layer and attributes".
  </li>
  <li>Click "OK".</li>
  <li>If you have previously chosen to specify the rotation angle by mouse, you
  now have to first specify a reference point for the rotation and then a
  target point. The rotation angle is the angle enclosed by the reference
  point, center of rotation and target point.</li>
