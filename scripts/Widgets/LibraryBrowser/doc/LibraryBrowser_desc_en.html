<p>The part libraries of QCAD are collections of symbols and other drawing files
that can be used in your drawings. To insert an item from a part library,
you need to show the library browser first using this tool. 
<br />Parts can be inserted into your drawing using drag and drop. Once the
mouse cursor is inside the drawing area, you can use the regular snap tools to
position the inserted part and the options tool bar to scale, flip or rotate
the part.</p>
